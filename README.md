# Weather Prediction Web Application

**Description:**
This project involves building a web application to predict weather conditions based on user input using a machine learning model. The application utilizes a trained XGBoost model to provide real-time weather predictions and includes features for visualizing weather data and distributions.

**Skills Takeaway From This Project:**
- Python programming
- Streamlit
- XGBoost
- Data Visualization with Plotly
- Model Deployment

**Domain:**
Data Science and Machine Learning

**Problem Statement:**
Predict weather conditions based on user input parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather-related features. This helps users understand potential weather outcomes based on their selected parameters.

**Dataset Information:**
The dataset contains the following columns:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Precipitation (%)
- Cloud Cover
- UV Index
- Visibility (km)
- Season
- Location
- Weather Type (dependent variable)

**Tasks:**

**Task 1: Data Preparation**
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Encode categorical features and standardize numerical features.

**Task 2: Model Training**
- Train an XGBoost model to predict weather types based on the input features.
- Evaluate model performance and perform any necessary tuning.

**Task 3: Web Application Development**
- Develop a Streamlit application to allow users to input weather parameters and receive predictions.
- Implement features for visualizing dataset summaries, distributions, and categorical value counts using Plotly.
